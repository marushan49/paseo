/**
 * The expanded set with its two ways of growing wired up, and with what the user decides about
 * it kept where it survives a restart.
 *
 * Attaching and scanning both need a host to ask, so they live in this thin shell rather than in
 * the meta row — a row whose workspace has no server keeps rendering the plain list and nothing
 * breaks. The decisions go to the daemon, which stores them on the workspace record and hands
 * them back in its snapshot; the store here is the write-through cache in between.
